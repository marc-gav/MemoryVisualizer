# MemoryVisualizer
Memory Visualization Tool for C++ Programs

This educational tool is designed to help students and developers gain a deeper understanding of memory management in C++ by providing real-time visualization of the stack and heap memory regions used by a running C++ program. It offers a visual representation of memory allocation, deallocation, and the state of variables in these memory regions, making it a powerful learning aid.
